# House-Price-Prediction

The aim of this project is to predict the price of the house based on the attributes that are provided


in the following data set the attributes which are provided are independent variables and price is dependent on them 

step-1 :- converting the Raw data set in a dataframe format 

step-2 :- cleaning the data set 

step-3 :- finding the correlation among the data points/ attributes

step-4 :- splitting the data for training the model

step-5 :- Importing XGBoost classifier for predicitve analysis on the model

step-6 :- checking for R-squared error and Mean absolute error

step-7 :- plotting a scatter plot for checking the lenearity of the predictive model
